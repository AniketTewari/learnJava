# Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Different variables used in Java 

1)```String``` - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes







2)```int``` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123





3)```float``` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99





4)```char``` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes





5)```boolean``` - stores values with two states: true or false





## Declaring (Creating) Variables

Syntax

```type variableName = value;```

Where type is one of Java's types (such as ```int``` or ```String```)


*variableName* is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

***To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:***

a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "Shivangi":
```c 

String name = "Shivangi";
System.out.println(name);

````

***To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:***

 a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 5:
 
```c
int myNum = 5;
System.out.println(myNum);

```

***Note-that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:***

Change the value of myNum from 15 to 20:


```c
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);
```
**Final Variables**

If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

```c
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
```
**Other Types**

```c
int myNum = 5;
```

```c
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
```

```c
char myLetter = 'D';
```

```c
boolean myBool = true;
```


```c
String myText = "Hello";
```

## Types of variables


*1)Local variables*


*2)Instance variables*


*3)Static variables*



**Local Variables**
A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. 

These variables are created when the block is entered, or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.
The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variables are declared, i.e., we can access these variables only within that block.
```
Initialization of the local variable is mandatory before using it in the defined scope.
```

```c
/*package whatever //do not write package name here */
// Contributed by Shubham Jain
import java.io.*;

class GFG {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int var = 10; // Declared a Local Variable
		// This variable is local to this main method only
		System.out.println("Local Variable: " + var);
	}
}
```

*Output*
```
Local Variable: 10
```
**Instance Variables**

Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside of any method, constructor, or block. 

As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.


Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier, then the default access specifier will be used.


Initialization of an instance variable is not mandatory. Its default value is 0.


Instance variables can be accessed only by creating objects.

```c

/*package whatever //do not write package name here */

import java.io.*;

class GFG {

	public String geek; // Declared Instance Variable

	public GFG()
	{ // Default Constructor

		this.geek = "Shivangi Singh"; // initializing Instance Variable
	}
//Main Method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		// Object Creation
		GFG name = new GFG();
		// Displaying O/P
		System.out.println("Geek name is: " + name.geek);
	}
}

```

*Output*

```
Geek name is: Shivangi Singh
```

**Static Variables**

Static variables are also known as ```class variables.``` 

These variables are declared similarly as instance variables. The difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside of any method, constructor or block.



Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class, irrespective of how many objects we create.

Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.


Initialization of a static variable is not mandatory. Its default value is 0.


If we access a static variable like an instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show a warning message, which wonâ€™t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name with the class name automatically.


If we access a static variable without the class name, the compiler will automatically append the class name.

```c

/*package whatever //do not write package name here */

import java.io.*;

class GFG {

public static String geek = "Shivangi Singh";		 //Declared static variable

	public static void main (String[] args) {
		
	//geek variable can be accessed without object creation
	//Displaying O/P
	//GFG.geek --> using the static variable
		System.out.println("Geek Name is : "+GFG.geek);
	}
}

```



*Output*
```
Geek Name is : Shivangi Singh
```

## Differences between the Instance variables and the Static variables

```
We can access instance variables through object references, and static variables can be accessed directly using the class name.
```


**Syntax: Static and instance variables**

```c
class GFG
{
    // Static variable
    static int a; 
    
    // Instance variable
    int b;        
} 
```
